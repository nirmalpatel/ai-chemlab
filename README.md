# Chemistry Virtual Lab

A 3D interactive chemistry virtual lab built with Three.js that allows users to perform simple experiments like pouring liquids between beakers.

## Features

- 3D beakers with realistic glass appearance
- Liquid simulation with color
- Drag and tilt beakers to pour liquids
- Mixing of liquids between beakers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL
- A local web server (recommended for development)

### Running the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Start a local web server in the project directory
   - You can use Python's built-in server: `python -m http.server`
   - Or use a Node.js server like `live-server`
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port your server uses)

## How to Use

- Drag a beaker to move it around
- Drag a beaker upward to tilt it
- Tilt a beaker near another one to pour liquid from one to another
- Use the mouse to orbit around the scene (click and drag)
- Scroll to zoom in and out

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript modules
- CSS for styling

## Future Enhancements

- Add more types of laboratory equipment (test tubes, flasks)
- Implement chemical reactions based on mixed substances
- Add particle effects for reactions
- Create a UI to select different chemicals
- Add temperature simulation
